# Gamer Addiction

## Objective

This article aims to identify and describe the issue of children addiction to games rather than propose a solution. This is entirely based on my opinion and how I see the problem. You may disagree and if so I challenge you to propose a different view. Solutions are left to your creativity.

## The issue

Our children have become addicted to games in a prevalent way that this has become the common issue in most homes. Kids spend too much time playing computer games on the internet. They spend hours glued to the screen in an excited non-productive manner.

## Gamer Needs

All gamers share a common set of requirements to be able to operate. Not having on of the following may hinder or altogether prevent a gamer from doing what they love.

### Games

Games such as Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft have become very popular. If one kid is playing it all are.
You can't play a game if you don't have a game.

### Devices

Devices such as PCs, laptops, iPads, iPhones, PS(n)s are essential for the game experience. Kids and parents are paying large sums of money to obtain them. Many homes have many versions of the PlayStation (2, 3, and 4) and others have different Nintendo consoles such as the Wii. If parents are not willing to shed the money kids can receive them in the form of gifts or purchase them from money gifts.
Devices have become ubiquitous. There is always a device available to play with.

You can't play games if you don't have a device to play on. But there are lots of devices around.

### Internet

Wi-Fi, and ISP subscription are necessary for on-line gaming. We supply these services to the home residence without any monitoring or restriction on content and time. They are the gateway to the internet and without them there is no internet.
Only a few games are dependent on the internet but they make up the majority of games played these days.

### Time

Children are spending more and more time on games. It is consuming their lives. They are staying late at night to play. They wake up early in the morning to play. They eat in their rooms to play some more. They even forego social events and visits in favor of spending more time at the game. Naturally, kids want to spend less time studying and reading. They simply don't have the time.
You can't play games if you don't have time.

## Gamer Wants

Gamers want a certain environment for their addiction to thrive.

### Belonging

The social circle is growing as more and more kids are sucked into gaming. On-line gaming provides a platform for friends to play together even when they are not physically together, but not exclusively.

> Some kid

This social circle is feeding the addiction. Kids are competing with each other to be the best of the best. Everybody wants to get ahead. This social circle includes kids from school, relatives, friends, as well as complete strangers that have become _best friends_.

### YouTube and Twitch

Gamers love to watch other gamers playing and commenting as they play games. Some are considered heroes and some use their names as part of their own usernames. So we are talking about role models that are broadcasting daily and their content is consumed daily. While listening to them may improve your English it can also influence the viewer in other ways. These _heroes_ present there mannerisms and language as they play. Language that is readily accepted by the children watching.
While YouTube and Twitch are not necessary for gamers to practice their addiction it certainly helps feed the addiction. Reducing access may have limited influence on the gamers.

### Parents ignorance

Let's face it, parents have no idea what their kids are playing most of the time. They don't know the name of the game, how it played, what events take place in it, what the characters look like, how they are dressed, what language is used, or does it contain sex or violence or drug abuse. Parents are clueless. This makes for a good environment for children to choose how they play and what they do in the game.
Somehow, parents care more about the physical form of the gaming device than the game content. It's only a game, how bad can it be?

### Parental discord

One partner cannot save if the other spends. Both parents must be in agreement and in synch when it comes to what games they allow their children to play. There is no point for the father to take prevention measures when the mother makes concessions all the time. Similarly, there is no point for the mother to keep her child on a diet when the father keeps giving him/her candy. Children are very smart and know how to take advantage of this situation to the max.
The larger the discord between the parents the more agreeable the environment for gaming.

## Conclusion

This is an attempt to shed light on all aspects of the gamer addition issue to better understand its aspects. It is not meant to propose a solution. Solutions are left to your creativity.
