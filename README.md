## The issue

Our children have become addicted to games in a prevelant way that this has become the common issue in most homes. Kids spend too much time playing computer games on the internet. They spend hours glued to the screen in an excited non-productive manner.

## Gamer Needs

Games such as Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft have become very popular. If one kid is playing it all are.
You can't play a game if you don't have a game.

### Devices

Devices such as PCs, laptops, iPads, iPhones, PS(n)s are essential for the game experience. Kids and parents are paying large sums of money to obtain them. Many homes have many versions of the PlayStation (2, 3, 4) and others have different Nintendo consoles such as the wii. If parents are not willing to shed the money kids can receive them in the form of gifts or purchase them from money gifts.
Devices have become ubiquitous. There is always a device available to play with.
